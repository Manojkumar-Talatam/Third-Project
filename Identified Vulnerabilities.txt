 Identified Vulnerabilities and Their Severity:

1. SSL Self-Signed Certificate

Severity: Medium

Description: Server uses a self-signed SSL certificate.

Mitigation: Purchase and install an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).



2. TLS Version 1.0 and 1.1 Enabled

Severity: High

Description: Obsolete versions of TLS are supported, which are known to be insecure.

Mitigation: Disable TLS 1.0/1.1 and enforce TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3.



3. Missing Security Headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)

Severity: Medium

Description: HTTP security headers are not set, exposing users to browser-based attacks.

Mitigation: Add necessary headers in server configurations (e.g., Apache or NGINX settings).



4. Directory Listing Enabled

Severity: Medium

Description: Web server directory listing is enabled, exposing file structures.

Mitigation: Disable directory listing via server config.



5. Outdated Software/Plugins

Severity: High

Description: Use of outdated web frameworks or plugins with known CVEs.

Mitigation: Update all software, frameworks, and plugins to the latest stable versions.

Among the above listed vulnerabilities,

Most Critical Vulnerabilities :

1. Obsolete TLS Versions (TLS 1.0/1.1)

Severity: High

Risk: Vulnerable to encryption downgrade attacks.

Fix: Disable TLS 1.0/1.1 and use TLS 1.2 or 1.3.



2. Outdated Software/Plugins

Severity: High

Risk: Known exploits can be used against outdated components.

Fix: Update all software, frameworks, and plugins to the latest versions.
